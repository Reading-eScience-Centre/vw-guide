# Videoconferencing Software

The following videoconferencing software is installed on the video wall:

* GoToMeeting
* IOCOM Visimeet
* Skype

and is all available through the usual menus.  With the exception of Skype, all of the software runs in the same way as on a desktop machine.  For Skype, the handling of the video cameras is a little different.  For further details, see [the section on cameras](05-cameras.md).

Note that you can also use WebEx for videoconferencing - this is initiated over the web and requires no separate installation.

If you do require additional software for videoconferencing, please contact the video wall team at [resc@rdg.ac.uk](mailto:resc@rdg.ac.uk) and we will do our best to install it for you.
